# KidneyAllocation.jl

[![Build Status](https://github.com/jojal5/KidneyAllocation.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jojal5/KidneyAllocation.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

A Julia package for representing kidney donors and recipients, computing key transplant indices (EPTS and KDRI), and evaluating allocation compatibility and score.

> No real clinical or confidential information is included.**

## Overview

KidneyAllocation.jl provides:

- Simple, validated structures for **Donor** and **Recipient**
- HLA typing using compact `HLA` integers
- ABO compatibility checks
- **EPTS** (recipient survival index)
- **KDRI** (donor risk index)
- A combined **allocation score** for donor–recipient matching used by Transplant Québec

---

## 🫘 Donor Structure

```julia
struct Donor <: TransplantEntity
    arrival::DateTime
    age::Int64
    blood::ABOGroup
    a1::HLA; a2::HLA
    b1::HLA; b2::HLA
    dr1::HLA; dr2::HLA
    kdri::Float64
end
```

Example:

```julia
donor = Donor(DateTime(2025,1,1), 45, A, 24, 26, 44, 51, 1, 4, 1.27)
```

---

## 👤 Recipient Structure

```julia
struct Recipient <: TransplantEntity
    birth::DateTime
    dialysis::DateTime
    arrival::DateTime
    blood::ABOGroup
    a1::HLA; a2::HLA
    b1::HLA; b2::HLA
    dr1::HLA; dr2::HLA
    CPRA::Int64
    expiration_date::Union{DateTime,Nothing}
end
```

Example:

```julia
recipient = Recipient(DateTime(1985,5,1), DateTime(2015,1,1),
                      DateTime(2024,1,1), A, 24,26, 44,51, 1,4, 80)
```

---

## 📈 EPTS

Compute Estimated Post-Transplant Survival for a `recipient::Recipient` having no history of diabetes and no prior transplant in date of 2025-12-09 :

```julia
KidneyAllocation.calculate_epts(recipient, false, false, Date(2025,12,09))
```

---

## 📈 KDRI

Compute Kidney Donor Risk Index for a donor with the following characteristics:
- age = 52
- height = 183 cm
- weight = 81 kg
- history of hypertension = true
- diabetes = false
- cerebrovascular accident is the cause of death (COD) = true
- serum creatinine = 1.7 mg/dL
- donor was recovered as a DCD = true

```julia
KidneyAllocation.evaluate_kdri(52, 183, 81, true, false, true, 1.7, true)
```

---

## 🧮 Allocation Score

A donor–recipient match score:

```julia
score(donor, recipient)
```

Includes components such as wait time, DR mismatch, CPRA, age gap, etc.

---

## 🔧 Example Workflow

```julia
donor = Donor(DateTime(2025,1,1), 40, O,
              24, 26,
              44, 51,
              1, 4,
              1.1)

recipient = Recipient(
    DateTime(1990,3,15),
    DateTime(2018,1,1),
    DateTime(2024,1,10),
    O,
    24, 26,
    44, 55,
    1, 3,
    95
)

if is_abo_compatible(donor.blood, recipient.blood)
    println("Score = ", score(donor, recipient))
else
    println("Recipient is ABO-incompatible with this donor.")
end
```
